= Using Helm Commands

The plugin `com.citi.helm-commands` allows you to use Helm commands directly, similar to what you would do
with the Helm CLI. `helm-commands` is also implied by all the other plugins in the suite.

For most Helm CLI commands, there is a corresponding Gradle task type (except for commands that do not really make
sense for a build script, like `helm search` or `helm inspect`).

NOTE: In most cases it is more convenient to use the high-level DSL provided by the other plugins to manage your
charts in a declarative way.

for a full list of available tasks.


== Example

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
import com.citi.gradle.plugins.helm.command.tasks.*

plugins {
    id 'com.citi.helm-commands' version '<VERSION>'
}

task installMariaDb(type: HelmInstall) {
    chart = 'stable/mariadb'
    version = '4.3.1'
    releaseName = 'mariadb'
}
